      What is HTML? 
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language 
        HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
        HTML describes the structure of a Web page HTML consists of a series of elements HTML
        elements tell the browser how to display the content HTML elements label
        pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph",
        "this is a link", etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
        The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
        The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
        The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
        The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
        The <h1> element defines a large heading
        The <p> element defines a paragraph
    </p>

        What is an HTML Element?
            An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
            <tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>
            The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:

            <h1>My First Heading</h1>
            <p>My first paragraph.</p>

            Start tag	        Element content	            End tag

            <h1>	            My First Heading	            </h1>
            <p>	              My first paragraph.	          </p>
            <br>	            none	                        none
        Note: Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elementsdo not have an end tag!
    </p>

        Role of Web Browsers
            The purpose of a web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) is to read HTML documents and display them correctly.
            A browser does not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document.
